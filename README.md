## A Student Management System for use by Teachers

***
Full stack web application that manages student data for teachers of an institution. Uses ExpressJS, EJS, MongoDB (mongoose), and node.js.

The application is being hosted and can be accessed [here.](https://inf-zen.herokuapp.com/)


DISCLAIMER:

This is a proof-of-concept application, and was created for the Internal Assessment for the Computer Science Higher Level course as part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. As such, it is not in use anymore, and serves no actual purpose. Don't go crazy with the edits.
